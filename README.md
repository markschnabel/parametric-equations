Parametric Equations
===
This repository contains programs written in Processing (a teaching language based upon Java for creating code art). The programs take advantage of parametric equations and trigonomic functions to create interesting spiral-like graphics.

What is a parametric equation?
---
Parametric equations are incredibly similar to the famous equation: y = mx + b also known as slope-intercept form or a linear equation. In the equation y = mx + b values of x are plugged in and values of y are returned. A parametric equation is incredibly similar in the sense that variables are derived from plugging in the value of another variable. In the case of parametric equations variables x and y are both determined by plugging in a variable t to some equation.
Example: x = 2t, y = t^2

Implementation into the program
---
Since parametric equations produce x and y values these values could correspond to points on a cartesian plane. The programming language Processing comes with many features that are centered around creating art with code. One of these features is Processing's "draw" function which is essentially a mainloop for the program. The program continuously iterates over the code contained within the draw function "drawing" whatever it is told to on the screen. In this particular program lines are drawn using the x and y values generated by parametric equations. The equations utilize sin() and cos() functions to produce interesting x and y coordinates. The variable t is incremented each iteration of the loop so that the equations continuously produce new values to assign to x and y.

The code has been uploaded to https://www.openprocessing.org/ a website which allows Processing developers to upload their Processing programs or sketches where they can then be run in the browser for easy sharing.
